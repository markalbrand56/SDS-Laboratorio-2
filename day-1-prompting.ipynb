   "source": "# Day 1 - Prompting\n\nWelcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n\nThis notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.",

Its enduring importance is interwoven with history, culture, economics, and even environmental sustainability, creating a tapestry of impact that resonates across diverse sectors globally.  While its role as a staple food remains central, the olive's influence is increasingly felt in areas such as health, industry, and landscape preservation, solidifying its relevance in the 21st century.\n",

Olive oil, derived from the fruit's pressing, is arguably the most significant product, forming the cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, widely recognized for its health benefits.

Su influencia se puede resumir en los siguientes puntos:\n\n* **Reafirmación del Muscle Car:** En una época donde la eficiencia de combustible y los vehículos pequeños dominaban el mercado, el Challenger 2015, junto con su rival el Ford Mustang y el Chevrolet Camaro, representó una reafirmación del muscle car americano.  Ofreció una propuesta de valor clara: potencia, estilo retro y un rugido potente a un precio relativamente accesible (en comparación con superdeportivos).  Este resurgimiento ayudó a mantener viva una parte importante de la historia y la cultura automovilística estadounidense.\n\n* **Éxito comercial inesperado:**  A pesar de su tamaño y consumo de combustible, el Challenger encontró un mercado sorprendentemente amplio.  Su diseño nostálgico, que evocaba la época dorada de los muscle cars de los años 60 y 70, resultó ser un gancho poderoso para un público amplio,  que iba desde los nostálgicos hasta una nueva generación de entusiastas.  Sus altas ventas superaron expectativas y mostraron a los fabricantes que aún existía una demanda por vehículos potentes y con personalidad.\n\n* **Impulso a la competencia:** La popularidad del Challenger (y el éxito renovado del Mustang y Camaro) impulsó la competencia entre los fabricantes americanos en el segmento de los muscle cars.  Esto llevó a una \"carrera armamentística\" en términos de potencia, tecnología y características, beneficiando al consumidor con modelos cada"

You can change colors, symbols, the information displayed, and even create custom themes.\n\n* **Integrate with various tools:** It supports virtual environments (venv, conda, node), and allows you to integrate other information into your prompt.\n\nIn short, it's a tool to make working with Git easier and visually more informative within your shell.  The script sets up functions to handle the fetching of Git status, formatting it for display, and integrating the results into your shell's `PS1` (prompt) variable.\n"
